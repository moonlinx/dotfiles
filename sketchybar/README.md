# SketchyBar Config

This repository is my personal configuration for [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar), a macOS plugin to customize the top menu bar. My configuration is largely derived from and built upon [this repository](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles).

## Notable Enhancements

In addition to possessing all the features of the aforementioned configuration, this also offers the following improvements:

- **Battery Health** information, displayed when the Battery Widget is clicked.
- Redesigned **Calendar Widget** that takes up less space and opens Calendar when clicked.
- **Clipboard Widget** that displays up to five of your last copied items. Clicking an item re-copies it.
- Support for a **JSON Configuration File** to customize various aspects of the bar.
- Improved **Media Widget**, with superior play/pause functionality.
- **Restart Widget** to refresh SketchyBar; useful for development.
- **RAM Widget** that displays the current RAM utilization, along with a graph.
- **VPN Icon** that displays on the **Wifi Widget**, when a connected to a VPN.
- **Weather Widget** that displays current temperature and conditions, with a pop-up menu displaying semi-hourly forecast for the next two days.

## Configuration

The default configuration values are defined in full [here](settings.lua). You may overwrite any or all of them by creating a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project.

**A note about the weather**: The Weather Widget draws from [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in), which automatically determines your location based on IP address. However, their IP-to-location mapping mechanism is unreliable, especially when using a VPN. To recieve accurate location-based weather data, it may be advisable to configure one of the weather-related options below.
