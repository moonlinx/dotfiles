I need you to take a look at my script-picker.sh file for choosing scripts and help me make it
work.
I have included the continued error code that I receive. I want you to take a
look at it in regards to the code execution.

- Before you make any changes, ask me. We will determine implementation together
- After you implement, write what you did in the CLAUDE.md file so that I can
  look over it
- We will need to test at the end of every iteration

Error Code:

```bash
âœ” ./script-picker.sh
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/choose/0.1.0_4/libexec/bin/choose:138: SyntaxWarning: "is" with 'int' literal. Did you mean "=="?
  if len(names) is 1:

object repr     : AttributeError("'str' object has no attribute 'decode'")

./script-picker.sh: line 10: /Users/fox/Developer/Scripts/choose/.sh: File name too long
```

## Implementation Log

### Iteration 1: Fixed Selection Validation and Extension Handling

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed unnecessary sed command** - The `sed 's/\.[^.]*$//'` was stripping extensions from filenames, but the files already have `.sh` extensions and we need to preserve them
2. **Fixed path construction** - Changed from `"${selection}.sh"` to just `"$selection"` since filenames already include the extension
3. **Added validation** - Added check for both non-empty selection AND file existence with `[[ -n "$selection" && -f "$HOME/Developer/Scripts/choose/$selection" ]]`
4. **Added error messaging** - Script now shows what went wrong if selection fails

**Issues Addressed:**
- Fixed "File name too long" error caused by malformed path construction
- Added proper validation to prevent execution of invalid selections
- Simplified the pipeline by removing unnecessary text processing
