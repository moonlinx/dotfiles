# scripts

My personal collection of shell scripts!

## Organization

- `choose/` — Scripts that integrate with [`choose-gui`](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose) for fast fuzzy selection in a popup, similar to rofi or dmenu on linux.
- `stuff/` — Stores files used by the scripts, such as a list of all emojis.
- `term/` — Terminal workflow enhancements and productivity tools.
- other — System scripts for my stuff

## Dependencies

- bash or zsh
- choose-gui
- ffmpeg (for the cam script)
- You probably already have these:
  - ripgrep
  - bat
  - sed
- [skhd](https://github.com/moonlinx/dotfiles/blob/main/skhd/skhdrc) to bind scripts to hotkeys

## Inspiration

Many of these scripts were inspired by and even taken from:

- [Sylvan Franklin](https://github.com/SylvanFranklin)
- [Bread on Penguins](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins)
- [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz)
- [Michael O.](https://github.com/MichaelYoDev/.config)

I just made a few adjustments. All credit goes to these guys!
